2025-09-01 15:27:34 [!]  Amazon EKS will no longer publish EKS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) AMIs after November 26th, 2025. Additionally, Kubernetes version 1.32 is the last version for which Amazon EKS will release AL2 AMIs. From version 1.33 onwards, Amazon EKS will continue to release AL2023 and Bottlerocket based AMIs. The default AMI family when creating clusters and nodegroups in Eksctl will be changed to AL2023 in the future.

```
Step 2: create a pv for workflow
```
kubectl create namespace argo
kubectl apply -f pv.yaml
kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
```

Step 3: create a service account, the workflow needs to provision pod and other resources

```
kubectl apply -f sa-rbac.yaml
```

Step 4: create a docker secret
```
  kubectl create secret docker-registry dockerhub-secret \
  --docker-username=udemykcloud534 \
  --docker-password=Diehard_12 \
  --docker-email=ranjinimanjunath2025@gmail.com \
  -n argo
```
Step 5: Install argo rollout
```
kubectl apply -n argo -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.yaml
```

Step 6: create a workflow

```
argo submit -n argo /Users/ranjiniganeshan/udemy/Argocd/guestbook-ui-app/worflow.yaml  --watch
```
```

Step 7: verify if the workflow works

```
kubectl get pods -n argo

```
Step 8: verify the workflow
```
argo logs -n argo @latest --follow  

```
